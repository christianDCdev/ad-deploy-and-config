<h1>Active Directory Deployment and Configuration</h1>
Welcome back!  In this project we will be building upon the Active Directory environment created in the previous project.
<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

-  Please complete <a href="https://github.com/christianDCdev/ad-deploy-and-config">Setup for Active Directory Infrastructure</a> before beginning this project

<h2>Objectives</h2>

- Install Active Directory
- Create an Active Directory Forest
- Create a Domain Admin User
- Join Client-1 to the Domain
- Set up Remote Desktop for non-administrative users

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

<h3>&#9312; Install Active Directory</h3>
<p>

- Connect to your DC-1 VM via Remote Desktop
- Open Server Manager Application
- Click "Add Roles and Features"
- Click "Next" until you reach "Server Roles"
- Select "Active Directory Domain Services" and click "Add Features"

- Click "Next" until you reach "Confirmation"
- Check box that says "Restart the destination server automatically if required"
- Click "Install" to complete installation
  
</p>

<h3>&#9313; Promote DC-1 to a Domain Controller</h3>

<p>

- Within the Server Manager Dashboard, click on the flag at top right and click "Promote this server to a domain controller"

- Select "Add a new forest" option
- Set "Root domain name:" to "mydomain.com"
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OtjZXv7.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="domain controller promotion"/>

- Under "DNS options", uncheck "Create DNS delegation"
- Complete forest installation and your VM should automatically restart once installation is finished
- Log back into DC-1 VM as a domain user by typing "mydomain.com\(your username)" as your username (Example: mydomain.com\labuser)

</p>
<br />

<h3>&#9314; Create a Domain Admin user within the domain</h3>

<p>

- Within DC-1 VM, open Active Directory Users and Computers application
- Right click "mydomain.com" on the right side of window
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/h7KNfAb.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="AD user mydomain"/>

- Click "New" then click "Organizational Unit"
- Fill in the name as "_EMPLOYEES" and click "Ok"
- Create another organizational unit
- Fill in the name as "_ADMINS"
- Click on the "_ADMINS" folder
- Within the empty field on the right, right click -> click "New" -> then click "User"
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eknzFYE.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="new user"/>

- Fill out fields for a new user named "Jane Doe" with username "jane_admin"
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ze0cl5V.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="jane doe info"/>

- Proceed and finish user creation (NOTE: Feel free to uncheck "User must change password at next logon" box for your convenience)
- Next we will add jane_admin to the built-in "Domain Admins" Security Group
- Right click on "Jane Doe" and click "Properties"
- Navigate to "Member of" tab -> click "Add"
- Type "Domain Admins" in the empty field
- Click "Check Names" to confirm you found the correct object name, click "Ok", then click "Apply"
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MwxvjCA.png" alt="add jane to domain admins"/>

- Close or logout of the DC-1 VM connection
- Log back into DC-1 VM as "Jane Doe" (mydomain.com\jane_admin)
- From now on user "jane_admin" will be used as the admin account
  
</p>
<br />

<h3>&#9315; Join Client-1 to your Domain</h3>

<p>

- Login to Client-1 VM as original local admin (in my case username = "labuser")
- Within the Client-1 VM, right click Windows start button -> then click "System"
- Click "Rename this PC (advanced)" on the right side of window
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VMU4jgm.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Rename PC"/>

- Under "Computer Name" tab, click "Change
- Check "Domain" bubble, type "mydomain.com" in the field, then click "Ok"
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CHRciZK.png" alt="Domain change"/>

- A "Windows Security" window should pop up
- Fill in the username and password with "Jane Doe" information (Username: mydomain.com\jane_admin)
- Click "Ok" and if done correctly, you will see the following window pop up
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/35CF1Mr.png"  alt="Successfully joined domain"/>

- Click "Ok" and your VM will restart
- Within DC-1 VM, open "Active Directory Users and Computers" application
- Expand "mydomain.com" -> then click on "Computers" to verify if Client-1 is there
- 
  
</p>
<br />

<h3>&#9316; Setup Remote Desktop for Non-administrative users</h3>

<p>

- Log into Client-1 VM as "Jane Doe" (mydomain.com\jane_admin)
- Navigate to "Settings" -> "System" -> "Remote Desktop"
- Click on "Select users that can remotely access this PC" at the bottom of window
- Click "Add"
- Type "Domain Users" in empty field
- Click "Check Names" to confirm you found the correct object name and click "Ok"
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/a6nHqwn.png" alt="Successfully joined domain"/>

- Now all normal users within the domain can log into Client-1
  
</p>
<br />

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  
Congratulations on completing the deployment and configuration of this Active Directory project!  We should now have an active directory forest installed, a domain admin user, and our Client-1 VM should now be inside our domain.  In the next project we will populate our domain with generated users.
